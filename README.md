# True/False Quiz Game

Quiz game built in Python that asks a series of true/false questions.

## Main features

- Loads questions from a JSON file or an API.
- Asks each question and checks the user’s answer.
- Tracks the score through the quiz.
- Optional version with a simple Tkinter GUI.

## What I learned

- Loading and using JSON data.
- Splitting code into classes for questions, quiz logic and UI.
- Keeping game logic separate from presentation.
- Basic Tkinter windows and event handling.

## How to run

Open `main.py` in Python 3 and run the file.
